## 📌 About This Project

This is a modern and responsive personal portfolio website built using
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project showcases my skills, projects,
and experience in a clean and visually appealing layout.

The website includes smooth animations, responsive design for all screen
sizes, and an interactive user interface. It is designed to represent my
profile as a frontend developer and to serve as a professional portfolio
for internships and entry-level opportunities.
